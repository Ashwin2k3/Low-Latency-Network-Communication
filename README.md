The provided program, structured using the folder tree, is a basic example of a low-latency network communication module in C++. Here's a breakdown of what each component of the program does:

### **Program Overview**

1. **NetworkManager Class**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages network communication using Boost.Asio, a cross-platform C++ library for network and low-level I/O programming.
   - **Features**:
     - **Start**: Begins accepting incoming connections and handling client communication.
     - **Stop**: Stops the network manager and halts the I/O context.
     - **do_accept()**: Asynchronously accepts incoming client connections.
     - **do_read()**: Asynchronously reads data from the client socket.
     - **do_write()**: Asynchronously writes data back to the client socket (echoes data).

2. **Main Application (`main.cpp`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Entry point of the application.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Initializes a `NetworkManager` object with a specific host and port.
     - Starts the network manager, which begins accepting and handling connections.
     - Catches and prints exceptions if any errors occur during runtime.

3. **Utility Functions (`utility.hpp` and `utility.cpp`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Provides utility functions that can be used across the project.
   - **Example**: A placeholder function `process_data()` that could be used to process or manipulate data received from clients.

4. **Configuration File (`config.json`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Stores configuration parameters like the host and port used by the network manager.

5. **Testing (`tests/`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Contains tests for the network communication module.
   - **Functionality**:
     - **`test_network.cpp`**: Would include unit tests or other tests to validate the functionality of the `NetworkManager` class.

### **Program Behavior**

- **Server Functionality**:
  - The program sets up a TCP server using Boost.Asio.
  - The server listens on a specified port (12345 in this case) for incoming client connections.
  - Upon receiving a connection, it creates a new thread to handle the session with the client.
  - For each client, the server reads data from the client and echoes it back. This process continues until the client closes the connection.

- **Data Flow**:
  - When a client connects, the server accepts the connection and starts reading data from the client asynchronously.
  - The received data is then processed (e.g., printed to the console) and echoed back to the client.
  - The server continues to handle new connections and maintain existing ones.

### **Usage**

To run the program:

1. **Build the Project**:
   - Use CMake to generate build files and compile the project. For example, you can run:
     ```bash
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   - After building, run the executable to start the server:
     ```bash
     ./NetworkCommunication
     ```

3. **Connect a Client**:
   - Use a tool like `telnet` or `netcat` to connect to the server and test communication:
     ```bash
     telnet localhost 12345
     ```
   - Type a message and observe the server echo it back.

Overall, this program provides a basic foundation for network communication with a focus on low-latency handling and can be extended with additional features like handling different types of data, implementing more complex protocols, or integrating with other components.
